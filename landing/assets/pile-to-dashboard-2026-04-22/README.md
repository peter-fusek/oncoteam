# pile-to-dashboard-2026-04-22

Real-world "before vs after" desk shoot — the only Oncoteam asset set that shows the literal physical paper chaos and the literal Oncoteam digital answer (WhatsApp + dashboard built on top of Oncofiles) in the same room on the same day. **These four photos are the complete visual set — no separate dashboard or WhatsApp screenshots are needed.**

## Provenance

- **Shoot date:** 2026-04-22 (08:45–08:46 CEST)
- **Photographer:** Peter Fusek (own desk, own paper folder, own Oncofiles dashboard session, iPhone)
- **Source files:** Originals in `~/Downloads/IMG_9944.JPG` → `IMG_9947.JPG` on Peter's machine; renamed here for repo use.
- **Patient context:** Peter's own preventive-care file (general-health profile in Oncofiles, which Oncoteam reads from). The cover sheet's patient ID is hidden by a green sticker — confirm still hidden after any crop.
- **Licensing:** Internal Instarea use; cleared for marketing on Peter's personal LinkedIn channel and on `oncoteam.cloud` landing.

## Files

| # | File | Source | What's in it |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `01-paper-folder-cancer-textbook-2026-04-22.jpg` | IMG_9944.JPG | Closed paper folder of medical records next to DeVita *Cancer: Principles & Practice of Oncology* (12th ed.), Robert Macfarlane *Is a River Alive?*, Kip S. Thorne *Black Holes & Time Warps*, *The Wim Hof Method*. |
| 2 | `02-papers-spread-medical-records-2026-04-22.jpg` | IMG_9945.JPG | Same folder spread out: ProCare reports (Bratislava), ambulance "Dohoda o poskytovaní zdravotnej starostlivosti", vaccination cards, lab printouts, 1980s–1990s carbon-copy GP doctor notes. |
| 3 | `03-dashboard-1982-handwritten-ocr-2026-04-22.jpg` | IMG_9946.JPG | Wide shot: monitor showing `oncofiles.com/dashboard` v5.11.0.dev0 with a 1982 handwritten card rendered + structured page extraction in the right rail. Oncoteam's WhatsApp answers are powered by this same document layer. |
| 4 | `04-dashboard-1982-handwritten-ocr-detail-2026-04-22.jpg` | IMG_9947.JPG | Close-up of the dashboard's OCR view — same 1982 page with "STRANA 1 (538 ZNAKOV) / STRANA 2 (388 ZNAKOV)" extraction panel readable. |

## Use

- Landing-page demo blocks per `peter-fusek/oncoteam` GitHub issue (filed alongside this commit). Suggested hero: photo 02 (paper spread) overlaid or composited next to a dashboard.oncoteam.cloud / WhatsApp screenshot taken later.
- Mirrored at:
  - `linkedinmarketing/linkedin-marketing/assets/oncofiles-pile-to-dashboard-2026-04-22/`
  - `oncofiles/assets/landing/pile-to-dashboard-2026-04-22/`
- LinkedIn follow-up post (Oncoteam-led, single-image): `linkedinmarketing/.../crm/drafts/post-sk-phone-in-hand-2026-04-22.md` — uses photo 02 as the single image.

## Anonymisation pre-publish checklist

- [ ] Green sticker on cover sheet still hides patient ID after any crop (image 1, 2)
- [ ] No third-party patient name visible anywhere in image 2 spread
- [ ] Image 3: terminal text on iPad in foreground is at thumbnail scale — confirm no token/credential becomes legible if enlarged
- [ ] Image 4: browser tab strip at top of screen does not reveal third-party patient names

## SK terminology fix (matched in Oncoteam landing audit issue)

- Never use **"labky"** anywhere in landing copy, dashboard UI, AI prompt outputs, or WhatsApp command help / responses. Correct forms: **"labáky"** (informal) or **"laboráky"** (slightly more formal). Audit `landing/index.html`, `landing/i18n.js`, dashboard SK strings, WhatsApp command help text, and any AI prompt templates.
